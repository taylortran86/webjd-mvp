{"type": "ai", "content": "To separate from your partner in California, you can consider the following options: 1. Legal Separation: This is a court order that separates you from your partner without ending the marriage. You can ask the court to make orders on division of assets and debts, child and spousal support, and parenting issues. However, you cannot remarry or enter into a domestic partnership with someone else at the end of a legal separation. 2. Divorce: This is a legal proceeding that ends your marriage. You can ask the court to make orders on custody and visitation, child support, spousal/partner support, property division, and domestic violence restraining order. 3. Annulment: This is when a court says your marriage is not legally valid. It is difficult to prove and rarely granted. You should consult with an attorney to determine which option is best for you and your situation. Additionally, you can find more information on the California Courts website or by contacting the Self-Help Center.\n\nSource: https://sf.courts.ca.gov/self-help/divorce-separation-annulment"}
