    "expected_answer": "A divorce legally ends your marriage or domestic partnership, allowing you to remarry or enter a new domestic partnership.

  },
  {
    "question": "What is an annulment and when is it granted?",
    "expected_answer": "An annulment (or nullity) is when a court declares that your marriage or domestic partnership was never legally valid. Annulments are difficult to prove and rarely granted. Grounds include: petitioner's age at time of marriage, prior existing marriage, unsound mind, fraud, force, or physical incapacity."

  {
    "question": "What are the residency requirements for filing for divorce in San Francisco?",

    "question": "What does it mean that California is a 'no fault' divorce state?",
    "expected_answer": "California is a 'no fault' divorce state, which means you do not need to prove someone did something wrong. You just have to state that you cannot get along with the other party, which is legally called 'irreconcilable differences.'"
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between community property and separate property in California?",
    "expected_answer": "Community property is any asset or debt acquired during the marriage (from date of marriage to date of separation) and is usually divided equally in divorce.

  },
  {
    "question": "How long do you have to respond to a divorce petition?",
    "expected_answer": "You must file a Response with the court within 30 days after you were served. If you do not file a Response within 30 days, the court may make orders based on the requests in the Petition."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if your spouse doesn't respond to the divorce petition?",
    "expected_answer": "If your spouse fails to respond to your Petition, you can ask the Court to find your spouse in default, which means you can ask the Court to make the orders you requested without input from your spouse."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you ask for temporary orders while your divorce is pending?",
    "expected_answer": "Yes, you can ask the court to make pendente lite (temporary) orders once you file your case. You don't need to wait until your divorce is finalized to request orders for issues like child custody, support, or spousal support."

  },
  {
    "question": "Can you use a P.O. Box address on your court forms in San Francisco?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the date of separation and why is it important?",
    "expected_answer": "The date of separation is when there is a complete and final break in the marital relationship, determined by one spouse expressing intent to end the marriage and conduct consistent with that intent. It's important because anything acquired after this date is generally considered separate property rather than community property."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you cancel a summary dissolution after filing?",
    "expected_answer": "You cannot cancel once a judgment is entered. However, before judgment, you can file Form FL-830 (Notice of Revocation) and mail a copy to the other party. You don't need the other party's signature to revoke."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you don't complete financial disclosures?",
